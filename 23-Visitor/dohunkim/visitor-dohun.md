# Visitor

## Prerequisite

This documents assume that
 - You have basic knowledge of c#
 - You know how to read class diagram

&nbsp;
## 1. Intent
Represent an operation to be performed on the elements of an object structure. Visitor lets you define a new operation without changing the classes of the elements on which it operates.<sup>a)</sup>

## 2. Structure

## 3. Participants
- `Visitor`
    - The Visitor interface declares a set of visiting methods that can take concrete elements of an object structure as arguments. These methods may have the same names if the program is written in a language that supports overloading, but the type of their parameters must be different.
- `Concrete Visitor`
    - Each Concrete Visitor implements several versions of the same behaviors, tailored for different concrete element classes.
- `Element`
    - The Element interface declares a method for ‚Äúaccepting‚Äù visitors. This method should have one parameter declared with the type of the visitor interface.
- `Concrete Element`
    - Each Concrete Element must implement the acceptance method. The purpose of this method is to redirect the call to the proper visitor‚Äôs method corresponding to the current element class. Be aware that even if a base element class implements this method, all subclasses must still override this method in their own classes and call the appropriate method on the visitor object.
- `Client`
    - The Client usually represents a collection or some other complex object (for example, a Composite tree). Usually, clients aren‚Äôt aware of all the concrete element classes because they work with objects from that collection via some abstract interface.

## 4. Sample Code 
`Visitor`
```c#
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;

namespace RefactoringGuru.DesignPatterns.Visitor.Conceptual
{
    // The Component interface declares an `accept` method that should take the
    // base visitor interface as an argument.
    public interface IComponent
    {
        void Accept(IVisitor visitor);
    }

    // Each Concrete Component must implement the `Accept` method in such a way
    // that it calls the visitor's method corresponding to the component's
    // class.
    public class ConcreteComponentA : IComponent
    {
        // Note that we're calling `VisitConcreteComponentA`, which matches the
        // current class name. This way we let the visitor know the class of the
        // component it works with.
        public void Accept(IVisitor visitor)
        {
            visitor.VisitConcreteComponentA(this);
        }

        // Concrete Components may have special methods that don't exist in
        // their base class or interface. The Visitor is still able to use these
        // methods since it's aware of the component's concrete class.
        public string ExclusiveMethodOfConcreteComponentA()
        {
            return "A";
        }
    }

    public class ConcreteComponentB : IComponent
    {
        // Same here: VisitConcreteComponentB => ConcreteComponentB
        public void Accept(IVisitor visitor)
        {
            visitor.VisitConcreteComponentB(this);
        }

        public string SpecialMethodOfConcreteComponentB()
        {
            return "B";
        }
    }

    // The Visitor Interface declares a set of visiting methods that correspond
    // to component classes. The signature of a visiting method allows the
    // visitor to identify the exact class of the component that it's dealing
    // with.
    public interface IVisitor
    {
        void VisitConcreteComponentA(ConcreteComponentA element);

        void VisitConcreteComponentB(ConcreteComponentB element);
    }

    // Concrete Visitors implement several versions of the same algorithm, which
    // can work with all concrete component classes.
    //
    // You can experience the biggest benefit of the Visitor pattern when using
    // it with a complex object structure, such as a Composite tree. In this
    // case, it might be helpful to store some intermediate state of the
    // algorithm while executing visitor's methods over various objects of the
    // structure.
    class ConcreteVisitor1 : IVisitor
    {
        public void VisitConcreteComponentA(ConcreteComponentA element)
        {
            Console.WriteLine(element.ExclusiveMethodOfConcreteComponentA() + " + ConcreteVisitor1");
        }

        public void VisitConcreteComponentB(ConcreteComponentB element)
        {
            Console.WriteLine(element.SpecialMethodOfConcreteComponentB() + " + ConcreteVisitor1");
        }
    }

    class ConcreteVisitor2 : IVisitor
    {
        public void VisitConcreteComponentA(ConcreteComponentA element)
        {
            Console.WriteLine(element.ExclusiveMethodOfConcreteComponentA() + " + ConcreteVisitor2");
        }

        public void VisitConcreteComponentB(ConcreteComponentB element)
        {
            Console.WriteLine(element.SpecialMethodOfConcreteComponentB() + " + ConcreteVisitor2");
        }
    }

    public class Client
    {
        // The client code can run visitor operations over any set of elements
        // without figuring out their concrete classes. The accept operation
        // directs a call to the appropriate operation in the visitor object.
        public static void ClientCode(List<IComponent> components, IVisitor visitor)
        {
            foreach (var component in components)
            {
                component.Accept(visitor);
            }
        }
    }

    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            List<IComponent> components = new List<IComponent>
            {
                new ConcreteComponentA(),
                new ConcreteComponentB()
            };

            Console.WriteLine("The client code works with all visitors via the base Visitor interface:");
            var visitor1 = new ConcreteVisitor1();
            Client.ClientCode(components,visitor1);

            Console.WriteLine();

            Console.WriteLine("It allows the same client code to work with different types of visitors:");
            var visitor2 = new ConcreteVisitor2();
            Client.ClientCode(components, visitor2);
        }
    }
}
```
Output
```
The client code works with all visitors via the base Visitor interface:
A + ConcreteVisitor1
B + ConcreteVisitor1

It allows the same client code to work with different types of visitors:
A + ConcreteVisitor2
B + ConcreteVisitor2
```

## 5. Pros and Cons
### Pros üëç
- Open/Closed Principle. You can introduce a new behavior that can work with objects of different classes without changing these classes.
- Single Responsibility Principle. You can move multiple versions of the same behavior into the same class.
- A visitor object can accumulate some useful information while working with various objects. This might be handy when you want to traverse some complex object structure, such as an object tree, and apply the visitor to each object of this structure.

### Cons üëé
- You need to update all visitors each time a class gets added to or removed from the element hierarchy.
- Visitors might lack the necessary access to the private fields and methods of the elements that they‚Äôre supposed to work with.
