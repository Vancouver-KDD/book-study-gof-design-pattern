# State

## Prerequisite

This documents assume that
 - You have basic knowledge of c#
 - You know how to read class diagram

&nbsp;
## 1. Intent

Allow an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. The object will appear to change its class.<sup>a)</sup>

&nbsp;
## 2. Structure

## 3. Participants
- `Context`
    - Context stores a reference to one of the concrete state objects and delegates to it all state-specific work. The context communicates with the state object via the state interface. The context exposes a setter for passing it a new state object.
- `State`
    - The State interface declares the state-specific methods. These methods should make sense for all concrete states because you don‚Äôt want some of your states to have useless methods that will never be called.
- `Concrete Subscribers`
    - Concrete Subscribers perform some actions in response to notifications issued by the publisher. All of these classes must implement the same interface so the publisher isn‚Äôt coupled to concrete classes.
- `Concrete States`
    - Concrete States provide their own implementations for the state-specific methods. To avoid duplication of similar code across multiple states, you may provide intermediate abstract classes that encapsulate some common behavior.
    - State objects may store a backreference to the context object. Through this reference, the state can fetch any required info from the context object, as well as initiate state transitions.
- Both context and concrete states can set the next state of the context and perform the actual state transition by replacing the state object linked to the context.

## 4. Sample Code 
`Mediator`
```c#
using System;

namespace RefactoringGuru.DesignPatterns.State.Conceptual
{
    // The Context defines the interface of interest to clients. It also
    // maintains a reference to an instance of a State subclass, which
    // represents the current state of the Context.
    class Context
    {
        // A reference to the current state of the Context.
        private State _state = null;

        public Context(State state)
        {
            this.TransitionTo(state);
        }

        // The Context allows changing the State object at runtime.
        public void TransitionTo(State state)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Context: Transition to {state.GetType().Name}.");
            this._state = state;
            this._state.SetContext(this);
        }

        // The Context delegates part of its behavior to the current State
        // object.
        public void Request1()
        {
            this._state.Handle1();
        }

        public void Request2()
        {
            this._state.Handle2();
        }
    }
    
    // The base State class declares methods that all Concrete State should
    // implement and also provides a backreference to the Context object,
    // associated with the State. This backreference can be used by States to
    // transition the Context to another State.
    abstract class State
    {
        protected Context _context;

        public void SetContext(Context context)
        {
            this._context = context;
        }

        public abstract void Handle1();

        public abstract void Handle2();
    }

    // Concrete States implement various behaviors, associated with a state of
    // the Context.
    class ConcreteStateA : State
    {
        public override void Handle1()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("ConcreteStateA handles request1.");
            Console.WriteLine("ConcreteStateA wants to change the state of the context.");
            this._context.TransitionTo(new ConcreteStateB());
        }

        public override void Handle2()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("ConcreteStateA handles request2.");
        }
    }

    class ConcreteStateB : State
    {
        public override void Handle1()
        {
            Console.Write("ConcreteStateB handles request1.");
        }

        public override void Handle2()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("ConcreteStateB handles request2.");
            Console.WriteLine("ConcreteStateB wants to change the state of the context.");
            this._context.TransitionTo(new ConcreteStateA());
        }
    }

    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            // The client code.
            var context = new Context(new ConcreteStateA());
            context.Request1();
            context.Request2();
        }
    }
}
```
Output
```
Context: Transition to ConcreteStateA.
ConcreteStateA handles request1.
ConcreteStateA wants to change the state of the context.
Context: Transition to ConcreteStateB.
ConcreteStateB handles request2.
ConcreteStateB wants to change the state of the context.
Context: Transition to ConcreteStateA.

## 5. Pros and Cons
### Pros üëç
- Single Responsibility Principle. Organize the code related to particular states into separate classes.
- Open/Closed Principle. Introduce new states without changing existing state classes or the context.
- Simplify the code of the context by eliminating bulky state machine conditionals.

### Cons üëé
- Applying the pattern can be overkill if a state machine has only a few states or rarely changes.
