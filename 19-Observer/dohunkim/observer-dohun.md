# Observer

## Prerequisite

This documents assume that
 - You have basic knowledge of c#
 - You know how to read class diagram

&nbsp;
## 1. Intent

Define a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.<sup>a)</sup>

## 3. Participants
- `Publisher`
    - The Publisher issues events of interest to other objects. These events occur when the publisher changes its state or executes some behaviors. Publishers contain a subscription infrastructure that lets new subscribers join and current subscribers leave the list.
- When a new event happens, the publisher goes over the subscription list and calls the notification method declared in the subscriber interface on each subscriber object.
- `Subscriber`
    - The Subscriber interface declares the notification interface. In most cases, it consists of a single update method. The method may have several parameters that let the publisher pass some event details along with the update.
- `Concrete Subscribers`
    - Concrete Subscribers perform some actions in response to notifications issued by the publisher. All of these classes must implement the same interface so the publisher isn‚Äôt coupled to concrete classes.
- Usually, subscribers need some contextual information to handle the update correctly. For this reason, publishers often pass some context data as arguments of the notification method. The publisher can pass itself as an argument, letting subscriber fetch any required data directly.object.
- `Client`
    - The Client creates publisher and subscriber objects separately and then registers subscribers for publisher updates.

## 4. Sample Code 
`Mediator`
```c#
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Threading;

namespace RefactoringGuru.DesignPatterns.Observer.Conceptual
{
    public interface IObserver
    {
        // Receive update from subject
        void Update(ISubject subject);
    }

    public interface ISubject
    {
        // Attach an observer to the subject.
        void Attach(IObserver observer);

        // Detach an observer from the subject.
        void Detach(IObserver observer);

        // Notify all observers about an event.
        void Notify();
    }

    // The Subject owns some important state and notifies observers when the
    // state changes.
    public class Subject : ISubject
    {
        // For the sake of simplicity, the Subject's state, essential to all
        // subscribers, is stored in this variable.
        public int State { get; set; } = -0;

        // List of subscribers. In real life, the list of subscribers can be
        // stored more comprehensively (categorized by event type, etc.).
        private List<IObserver> _observers = new List<IObserver>();

        // The subscription management methods.
        public void Attach(IObserver observer)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Subject: Attached an observer.");
            this._observers.Add(observer);
        }

        public void Detach(IObserver observer)
        {
            this._observers.Remove(observer);
            Console.WriteLine("Subject: Detached an observer.");
        }

        // Trigger an update in each subscriber.
        public void Notify()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Subject: Notifying observers...");

            foreach (var observer in _observers)
            {
                observer.Update(this);
            }
        }

        // Usually, the subscription logic is only a fraction of what a Subject
        // can really do. Subjects commonly hold some important business logic,
        // that triggers a notification method whenever something important is
        // about to happen (or after it).
        public void SomeBusinessLogic()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("\nSubject: I'm doing something important.");
            this.State = new Random().Next(0, 10);

            Thread.Sleep(15);

            Console.WriteLine("Subject: My state has just changed to: " + this.State);
            this.Notify();
        }
    }

    // Concrete Observers react to the updates issued by the Subject they had
    // been attached to.
    class ConcreteObserverA : IObserver
    {
        public void Update(ISubject subject)
        {            
            if ((subject as Subject).State < 3)
            {
                Console.WriteLine("ConcreteObserverA: Reacted to the event.");
            }
        }
    }

    class ConcreteObserverB : IObserver
    {
        public void Update(ISubject subject)
        {
            if ((subject as Subject).State == 0 || (subject as Subject).State >= 2)
            {
                Console.WriteLine("ConcreteObserverB: Reacted to the event.");
            }
        }
    }
    
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            // The client code.
            var subject = new Subject();
            var observerA = new ConcreteObserverA();
            subject.Attach(observerA);

            var observerB = new ConcreteObserverB();
            subject.Attach(observerB);

            subject.SomeBusinessLogic();
            subject.SomeBusinessLogic();

            subject.Detach(observerB);

            subject.SomeBusinessLogic();
        }
    }
}

## 5. Pros and Cons
### Pros üëç
- Open/Closed Principle. You can introduce new subscriber classes without having to change the publisher‚Äôs code (and vice versa if there‚Äôs a publisher interface).
- You can establish relations between objects at runtime.

### Cons üëé
- Subscribers are notified in random order.
