# Strategy

## Prerequisite

This documents assume that
 - You have basic knowledge of java
 - You know how to read class diagram

&nbsp;
## 1. Intent
Define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.<sup>a)</sup>

## 3. Participants
- `Context`
    - The Context maintains a reference to one of the concrete strategies and communicates with this object only via the strategy interface.
- `Strategy`
    - The Strategy interface is common to all concrete strategies. It declares a method the context uses to execute a strategy.
- `Concrete Strategies`
    - Concrete Strategies implement different variations of an algorithm the context uses.
- The context calls the execution method on the linked strategy object each time it needs to run the algorithm. The context doesn‚Äôt know what type of strategy it works with or how the algorithm is executed.
- `Client`
    - The Client creates a specific strategy object and passes it to the context. The context exposes a setter which lets clients replace the strategy associated with the context at runtime.

## 4. Sample Code 
`Strategy`
```java
public interface DesignPattern {
    public void coding();
}

class Creational implements DesignPattern {
    @Override
    public void coding() {
        System.out.println("Studying Creational");
    }
}

class Structural implements DesignPattern {
    @Override
    public void coding() {
        System.out.println("Studying Structural");
    }
}

class Behavioral implements DesignPattern {
    @Override
    public void coding() {
        System.out.println("Studying Behavioral");
    }
}

public class Student {
    private DesignPattern dp;
    public void setDp(DesignPattern dp) {
        this.dp = dp;
    }
    public void study() {
        dp.coding();
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Student student = new Student();
        student.setDp(new Creational());
        student.study();
        student.setDp(new Structural());
        student.study();
        student.setDp(new Behavioral());
        student.study();
    }
}
```
Output
```
Studying Creational
Studying Structural
Studying Behavioral
```

## 5. Pros and Cons
### Pros üëç
- You can swap algorithms used inside an object at runtime.
- Open/Closed Principle. You can introduce new strategies without having to change the context.

### Cons üëé
- If you only have a couple of algorithms and they rarely change, there‚Äôs no real reason to overcomplicate the program with new classes and interfaces that come along with the pattern.
- Clients must be aware of the differences between strategies to be able to select a proper one.
